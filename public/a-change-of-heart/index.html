	<div class="entry-content"><p>As a twenty-something living in New York City, I held fast to the belief that eating out was way more cost-effective than attempting to do any sort of cooking at home. I&rsquo;d generally eat a big lunch at work and then come home to snack on something for dinner. I&rsquo;ve often been reprimanded by friends for subsisting entirely on Cheerios or chips + salsa. These always seemed like reasonable dinners to me. I&rsquo;m fairly certain that I didn&rsquo;t even turn on the stove in my apartment until at least 8 months of living here.</p>

<p>Things started to change when I joined the gym and found myself starving when I got home. Cheerios, chips, and salsa just weren&rsquo;t cutting it for dinner anymore. I upped my game by adding smoothies to my repertoire. Slowly but surely, I starting buying fruits and veggies to keep chopped up in the fridge and learned the magic of meal prep.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake was when I decided to try a vegetarian diet. It opened a whole new world of veggies to me &ndash; the likes of brussels sprouts and broccoli &ndash; and also made me realize that these things weren&rsquo;t that expensive in the grocery store and were a lot less hassle than going out to eat where the only vegetarian option was something like pasta or a boring salad.</p>

<p>I started to cook. And bake. And I loved it.</p>

<p>Lately I cook nearly every meal. I&rsquo;ve even adopted a rule regarding junk food: if I make it myself from scratch, it&rsquo;s OK to eat it (within reason of course). No buying cookies or ice cream at Fairway &ndash; I&rsquo;ve found simple substitutes to make all of these things myself by keeping a few ingredients on hand.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what this is about. I love making things that I can share with other people. From websites to dinner parties, making things that others enjoy is one of my greatest sources of happiness and satisfaction. And since I can&rsquo;t throw a dinner party every night (as much as I&rsquo;d love to), I thought I&rsquo;d start to document my adventures here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a mix of experiments, learning, recipes, thoughts, and who knows what. I just know that I want to make delicious, mostly healthy food, and share it with great people. Thanks for being one of those great people. :)</p>
