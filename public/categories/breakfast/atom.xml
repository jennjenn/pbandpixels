    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soft-boiled eggs are a bit of a new discovery for me. I mean, I knew they existed, but I never really tried them. I practically lived on hard-boiled eggs for a few months &ndash; I ate them every morning for breakfast after becoming a vegetarian and realizing I was severely lacking in protein intake. (Sans yolk. So gross.)</p>

<p>While watching Master Chef Junior a few weeks ago, I was totally taken by the soft-boiled egg challenge. They looked so tasty! After some research, I boiled my water, set my timer for 5 minutes, plunked my egg in, and crossed my fingers.</p>

<p>Magcially, the egg came out PERFECTLY. I&rsquo;m now a soft-boiled egg convert. It has all of the yolky goodness of my favorite Sunday-at-home breakfast (eggs sunny side up and an english muffin), but isn&rsquo;t as easy to screw up or under-cook as a sunny-side up egg. Amazing.</p>

<p>Another new discovery is the wonder of roasting veggies. They&rsquo;re so versatile and yummy. I bought 2 sweet potatoes at Trader Joe&rsquo;s the other day, not quite knowing what I&rsquo;d do with them, but they were cheap and I&rsquo;d figure it out later. I landed on sweet potato fries: roasted veggies in fast-food form!</p>

<p>My craving for soft boiled eggs and the two sweet potatoes sitting on my counter, haunting me, led me to this:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2013-11-19/sweetpotatosolders.jpg" alt="Soft-boiled Eggs and Spicy Sweet Potato Soldiers" /></p>

<p>So. Good. And filling. I wanted to try something a little more than throwing the sweet potatoes in the oven with some salt and pepper, so I settled on making them sweet and spicy.
<section class="recipe"></p>

<ul>
<li>2 medium sweet potatoes</li>
<li>~2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>good pinch of salt</li>
<li>bunch of ground black pepper</li>
<li>about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes (depending on how spicy you want them)</li>
</ul>


<p>Preheat the oven to 400ยบ. Cut your sweet potatoes into fries (or wedges!), throw them in a bowl, pour all of the seasonings &amp; olive oil on top and mix it all up. Spread it onto a cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper or a silpat to keep it all loose) and plunk them in the oven for 25-30 minutes.</p>

<p>When they&rsquo;re soft and have a little bit of brown to them, take them out and put them on a paper towel-lined plate to catch any rogue drops of olive oil.</p>

<p>While they&rsquo;re cooling a bit, time to boil up your water and put in your egg. Set your iPhone timer (it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing) to 5 minutes. Remove, cool SLIGHTLY (not too long or the egg will continue to cook), and peel.
</section></p>

<p>I managed to break the egg as I was peeling it so I sliced it in the middle, but ideally it would have been a slice off of the top so it could act more like a dipping cup. In this form it was a lot easier to roughly cut up the egg and eat it all together with a fork.</p>

<p>I could see this being a great brunch dish for a few people (soft-boiled eggs are too tempermental for a large group, I think), but for now it&rsquo;ll stick around as a great way to spice up leftover roasted veggies!</p>

<p>Next up: attempting to master the fried egg. Tricky sucker.</p>
