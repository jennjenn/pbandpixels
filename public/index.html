			Sweet Potato Soldiers + Soft Boiled Eggs</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Soft-boiled eggs are a bit of a new discovery for me. I mean, I knew they existed, but I never really tried them. I practically lived on hard-boiled eggs for a few months &ndash; I ate them every morning for breakfast after becoming a vegetarian and realizing I was severely lacking in protein intake. (Sans yolk. So gross.)</p>

<p>While watching Master Chef Junior a few weeks ago, I was totally taken by the soft-boiled egg challenge. They looked so tasty! After some research, I boiled my water, set my timer for 5 minutes, plunked my egg in, and crossed my fingers.</p>

<p>Magcially, the egg came out PERFECTLY. I&rsquo;m now a soft-boiled egg convert. It has all of the yolky goodness of my favorite Sunday-at-home breakfast (eggs sunny side up and an english muffin), but isn&rsquo;t as easy to screw up or under-cook as a sunny-side up egg. Amazing.</p>

<p>Another new discovery is the wonder of roasting veggies. They&rsquo;re so versatile and yummy. I bought 2 sweet potatoes at Trader Joe&rsquo;s the other day, not quite knowing what I&rsquo;d do with them, but they were cheap and I&rsquo;d figure it out later. I landed on sweet potato fries: roasted veggies in fast-food form!</p>

<p>My craving for soft boiled eggs and the two sweet potatoes sitting on my counter, haunting me, led me to this:</p>

<p><img src="http://sunsetkitchen.com/uploads/2013-11-20/sweetpotatosolders.jpg" alt="Soft-boiled Eggs and Spicy Sweet Potato Soldiers" /></p>

<p>So. Good. And filling. I wanted to try something a little more than throwing the sweet potatoes in the oven with some salt and pepper, so I settled on making them sweet and spicy.
<section class="recipe"></p>

<ul>
<li>2 medium sweet potatoes</li>
<li>~2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>good pinch of salt</li>
<li>bunch of ground black pepper</li>
<li>about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes (depending on how spicy you want them)</li>
</ul>


<p>Preheat the oven to 400ยบ. Cut your sweet potatoes into fries (or wedges!), throw them in a bowl, pour all of the seasonings &amp; olive oil on top and mix it all up. Spread it onto a cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper or a silpat to keep it all loose) and plunk them in the oven for 25-30 minutes.</p>

<p>When they&rsquo;re soft and have a little bit of brown to them, take them out and put them on a paper towel-lined plate to catch any rogue drops of olive oil.</p>

<p>While they&rsquo;re cooling a bit, time to boil up your water and put in your egg. Set your iPhone timer (it&rsquo;s a wonderful thing) to 5 minutes. Remove, cool SLIGHTLY (not too long or the egg will continue to cook), and peel.
</section></p>

<p>I managed to break the egg as I was peeling it so I sliced it in the middle, but ideally it would have been a slice off of the top so it could act more like a dipping cup. In this form it was a lot easier to roughly cut up the egg and eat it all together with a fork.</p>

<p>I could see this being a great brunch dish for a few people (soft-boiled eggs are too tempermental for a large group, I think), but for now it&rsquo;ll stick around as a great way to spice up leftover roasted veggies!</p>

<p>Next up: attempting to master the fried egg. Tricky sucker.</p>

			Pantry Grab Bag</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been craving a good, hearty sandwich lately. Growing up in New Jersey, sub sandwiches will always be close to my heart, but the whole vegetarian thing really throws a wrench into that gear. Since I moved away from home for college, the tradition has always been to pick up <a href="http://www.jerseymikes.com">Mike&rsquo;s Subs</a> for my first dinner at home &ndash; Ham and Provolone. No tomatoes, extra lettuce, light mayo, and all the seasonings. God I miss that sandwich.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m trying to find a replacement. Tough going considering I&rsquo;m trying to avoid both crappy bread AND meat, but I thought I&rsquo;d give it a shot. Presenting, my &ldquo;whatever&rsquo;s in the pantry&rdquo; <del>sandwich</del> rollup:</p>

<p><img src="http://sunsetkitchen.com/uploads/2013-11-19/IMG_6090-edited.jpg" alt="Grab Bag Sandwich" /></p>

<p>Appearance-wise: Not my best work, but let me tell you this thing was DELICIOUS. (Note to self: dig out the macro lens when you&rsquo;re not hungry). Today&rsquo;s version was leftovers from yesterday. I decided to add some sriracha to change it up a bit. Best. Decision. Ever.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in it (note my very precise measures.):
<section class="recipe"></p>

<ul>
<li>1 can Chickpeas (drained and rinsed)</li>
<li>~5 walnuts</li>
<li>a handful of dried cranberries (not the sweetened with juice kind)</li>
<li>~4-5 baby carrots</li>
<li>2 scallions</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>~3 tbsp low fat mayo</li>
<li>~2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>~1 tbsp agave nectar</li>
<li>leaf of lettuce</li>
<li>whole grain tortilla</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s dead simple: Mash up the chickpeas a bit. I used a potato masher. Chop up all the remaining veggies (except the lettuce) and nuts into about equal sizes and add them to the chickpeas. In a separate bowl, mix together the mayo, vinegar, and agave. Pour it over the veggie mix and combine. Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Break up the lettuce on the tortilla to create a base for the veggie filling. Spoon out about 3-4 tablespoons depending on the size of your tortilla. Add some sriracha if that&rsquo;s your thing (and it should be). Wrap it up and enjoy!
</section></p>

<p>For good measure, I have a small cup of strawberries and pomegranate on the side. Strawberries and pomegranates make me happy.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to have so much in the way of leftovers after making this yesterday, but it turns out to produce about 3-4 servings which is amazing. Leftovers win.</p>

<p>If I had some tahini lying around I may have swapped it out with the mayo for a vegan option. I also may experiment with using greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that may be an experiment for when I&rsquo;m slightly more daring.</p>

<p>Hopefully from here forward my photo quality will improve. Live and learn.</p>

<p>Oh and PS I made a perfect soft boiled egg for the first time today. Nothing photo-worthy as it was just more leftovers, but I&rsquo;ll definitely be making it again so stay tuned for that one.</p>

			A Change of Heart</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a twenty-something living in New York City, I held fast to the belief that eating out was way more cost-effective than attempting to do any sort of cooking at home. I&rsquo;d generally eat a big lunch at work and then come home to snack on something for dinner. I&rsquo;ve often been reprimanded by friends for subsisting entirely on Cheerios or chips + salsa. These always seemed like reasonable dinners to me. I&rsquo;m fairly certain that I didn&rsquo;t even turn on the stove in my apartment until at least 8 months of living here.</p>

<p>Things started to change when I joined the gym and found myself starving when I got home. Cheerios, chips, and salsa just weren&rsquo;t cutting it for dinner anymore. I upped my game by adding smoothies to my repertoire. Slowly but surely, I starting buying fruits and veggies to keep chopped up in the fridge and learned the magic of meal prep.</p>

<p>The icing on the cake was when I decided to try a vegetarian diet. It opened a whole new world of veggies to me &ndash; the likes of brussels sprouts and broccoli &ndash; and also made me realize that these things weren&rsquo;t that expensive in the grocery store and were a lot less hassle than going out to eat where the only vegetarian option was something like pasta or a boring salad.</p>

<p>I started to cook. And bake. And I loved it.</p>

<p>Lately I cook nearly every meal. I&rsquo;ve even adopted a rule regarding junk food: if I make it myself from scratch, it&rsquo;s OK to eat it (within reason of course). No buying cookies or ice cream at Fairway &ndash; I&rsquo;ve found simple substitutes to make all of these things myself by keeping a few ingredients on hand.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what this is about. I love making things that I can share with other people. From websites to dinner parties, making things that others enjoy is one of my greatest sources of happiness and satisfaction. And since I can&rsquo;t throw a dinner party every night (as much as I&rsquo;d love to), I thought I&rsquo;d start to document my adventures here.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;ll be a mix of experiments, learning, recipes, thoughts, and who knows what. I just know that I want to make delicious, mostly healthy food, and share it with great people. Thanks for being one of those great people. :)</p>
