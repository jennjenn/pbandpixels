I've been craving a good, hearty sandwich lately. Growing up in New Jersey, sub sandwiches will always be close to my heart, but the whole vegetarian thing really throws a wrench into that gear. Since I moved away from home for college, the tradition has always been to pick up [Mike's Subs](http://www.jerseymikes.com) for my first dinner at home - Ham and Provolone. No tomatoes, extra lettuce, light mayo, and all the seasonings. God I miss that sandwich.

So I'm trying to find a replacement. Tough going considering I'm trying to avoid both crappy bread AND meat, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Presenting, my "whatever's in the pantry" ~~sandwich~~ rollup:

Appearance-wise: Not my best work, but let me tell you this thing was DELICIOUS. (Note to self: dig out the macro lens when you're not hungry). Today's version was leftovers from yesterday. I decided to add some sriracha to change it up a bit. Best. Decision. Ever.

Here's what's in it (note my very precise measures.):
<section class="recipe">
	
* 1 can Chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
* ~5 walnuts
* a handful of dried cranberries (not the sweetened with juice kind)
* ~4-5 baby carrots
* 2 scallions
* salt and pepper
* ~3 tbsp low fat mayo
* ~2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* ~1 tbsp agave nectar
* leaf of lettuce
* whole grain tortilla

It's dead simple: Mash up the chickpeas a bit. I used a potato masher. Chop up all the remaining veggies (except the lettuce) and nuts into about equal sizes and add them to the chickpeas. In a separate bowl, mix together the mayo, vinegar, and agave. Pour it over the veggie mix and combine. Salt and pepper to taste.

Break up the lettuce on the tortilla to create a base for the veggie filling. Spoon out about 3-4 tablespoons depending on the size of your tortilla. Add some sriracha if that's your thing (and it should be). Wrap it up and enjoy!

For good measure, I have a small cup of strawberries and pomegranate on the side. Strawberries and pomegranates make me happy.

I wasn't expecting to have so much in the way of leftovers after making this yesterday, but it turns out to produce about 3-4 servings which is amazing. Leftovers win.

If I had some tahini lying around I may have swapped it out with the mayo for a vegan option. I also may experiment with using greek yogurt instead of mayo, but that may be an experiment for when I'm slightly more daring.

Hopefully from here forward my photo quality will improve. Live and learn.

Oh and PS I made a perfect soft boiled egg for the first time today. Nothing photo-worthy as it was just more leftovers, but I'll definitely be making it again so stay tuned for that one.
