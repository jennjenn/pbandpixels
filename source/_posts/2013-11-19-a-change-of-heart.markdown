As a twenty-something living in New York City, I held fast to the belief that eating out was way more cost-effective than attempting to do any sort of cooking at home. I'd generally eat a big lunch at work and then come home to snack on something for dinner. I've often been reprimanded by friends for subsisting entirely on Cheerios or chips + salsa. These always seemed like reasonable dinners to me. I'm fairly certain that I didn't even turn on the stove in my apartment until at least 8 months of living here.

Things started to change when I joined the gym and found myself starving when I got home. Cheerios, chips, and salsa just weren't cutting it for dinner anymore. I upped my game by adding smoothies to my repertoire. Slowly but surely, I starting buying fruits and veggies to keep chopped up in the fridge and learned the magic of meal prep.

The icing on the cake was when I decided to try a vegetarian diet. It opened a whole new world of veggies to me - the likes of brussels sprouts and broccoli - and also made me realize that these things weren't that expensive in the grocery store and were a lot less hassle than going out to eat where the only vegetarian option was something like pasta or a boring salad.

I started to cook. And bake. And I loved it.

Lately I cook nearly every meal. I've even adopted a rule regarding junk food: if I make it myself from scratch, it's OK to eat it (within reason of course). No buying cookies or ice cream at Fairway - I've found simple substitutes to make all of these things myself by keeping a few ingredients on hand.

So that's what this is about. I love making things that I can share with other people. From websites to dinner parties, making things that others enjoy is one of my greatest sources of happiness and satisfaction. And since I can't throw a dinner party every night (as much as I'd love to), I thought I'd start to document my adventures here.

It'll be a mix of experiments, learning, recipes, thoughts, and who knows what. I just know that I want to make delicious, mostly healthy food, and share it with great people. Thanks for being one of those great people. :)
