Soft-boiled eggs are a bit of a new discovery for me. I mean, I knew they existed, but I never really tried them. I practically lived on hard-boiled eggs for a few months - I ate them every morning for breakfast after becoming a vegetarian and realizing I was severely lacking in protein intake. (Sans yolk. So gross.)

While watching Master Chef Junior a few weeks ago, I was totally taken by the soft-boiled egg challenge. They looked so tasty! After some research, I boiled my water, set my timer for 5 minutes, plunked my egg in, and crossed my fingers.

Magcially, the egg came out PERFECTLY. I'm now a soft-boiled egg convert. It has all of the yolky goodness of my favorite Sunday-at-home breakfast (eggs sunny side up and an english muffin), but isn't as easy to screw up or under-cook as a sunny-side up egg. Amazing.

Another new discovery is the wonder of roasting veggies. They're so versatile and yummy. I bought 2 sweet potatoes at Trader Joe's the other day, not quite knowing what I'd do with them, but they were cheap and I'd figure it out later. I landed on sweet potato fries: roasted veggies in fast-food form!

My craving for soft boiled eggs and the two sweet potatoes sitting on my counter, haunting me, led me to this:

So. Good. And filling. I wanted to try something a little more than throwing the sweet potatoes in the oven with some salt and pepper, so I settled on making them sweet and spicy.
<section class="recipe">

* 2 medium sweet potatoes
* ~2 tbsp olive oil
* good pinch of salt
* bunch of ground black pepper
* about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes (depending on how spicy you want them)

Preheat the oven to 400ยบ. Cut your sweet potatoes into fries (or wedges!), throw them in a bowl, pour all of the seasonings & olive oil on top and mix it all up. Spread it onto a cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper or a silpat to keep it all loose) and plunk them in the oven for 25-30 minutes.

When they're soft and have a little bit of brown to them, take them out and put them on a paper towel-lined plate to catch any rogue drops of olive oil.

While they're cooling a bit, time to boil up your water and put in your egg. Set your iPhone timer (it's a wonderful thing) to 5 minutes. Remove, cool SLIGHTLY (not too long or the egg will continue to cook), and peel.

I managed to break the egg as I was peeling it so I sliced it in the middle, but ideally it would have been a slice off of the top so it could act more like a dipping cup. In this form it was a lot easier to roughly cut up the egg and eat it all together with a fork.

I could see this being a great brunch dish for a few people (soft-boiled eggs are too tempermental for a large group, I think), but for now it'll stick around as a great way to spice up leftover roasted veggies!

Next up: attempting to master the fried egg. Tricky sucker.
